- What are the current edge cases or issues in your current code?
  - Current solution does not have a11y support

### Test Cases:

- What will be the tests you will write for this component?
  - When user clicks on a star and moves away the stars to the left of it including itself should be highlighted

  - Render multiple StarRating components to make sure they are reusable in a single parent component
