## useFetch(url)

### Description

- Create a custom react hook called `useFetch(url)` which on mount should make a `fetch` call to the url. The useFetch should update whenever the url updates.
- After the fetch call the useFetch should return three values: the JSON response, loading state, error state

### Discuss about edge cases

- Since the fetch call will be made when url updates we need to set is loading as true again
- REMEMBER TO RESET Error and ResponseJSON
- Should abort or cancel the fetch call on unmount and stop setState actions in fetch call above
