## Why you should not use key as index for a list?

### Description

- `key` for a list helps react identify how to re-render the list of items.
- We should use something unique for key and should not use index if our list is dynamic which means we will add, delete items to the list
  - because if we use index and then add or delete items then the array list will update but the indexes are still there and react won't know that there was any update so we might have re-rendering issues if we use index
- if our list is static it is fine to use index

### Example

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const tasks = [
    { id: "1", title: "Get a haircut" },
    { id: "2", title: "Get groceries" },
  ];

  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task, idx) => (
        <>
          <div key={task.id}>{task.title} This is Correct ✅</div>
          <div key={idx}>{task.title} This is Wrong ❌</div>
        </>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};
```
