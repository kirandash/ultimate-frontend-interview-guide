## What is JSX?

- JSX is a syntax extension for JS that lets you write HTML like markup inside a JS file.
  - other frameworks might use different markups or different ways to write ex: using html file separately
- Benefits:
  - we have direct access to all the JS props directly in the markup. So it's easy to write logic for developers.

### Follow up questions

- Is JSX same as HTML?
  - No. JSX looks like HTML but it is a JS fn that is converted into a plain fn that returns some HTML.
- Is JSX only available in React?
  - No. JSX & React are two different things. They are independent. But JSX is used by React to write it's HTML. JSX can also be used by any other libraries.
