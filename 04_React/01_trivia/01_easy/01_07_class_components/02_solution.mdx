## What is a class component in react?

### Description

- it is an old approach and has been deprecated. Not recommended way anymore to use class components. So use fn components instead.
- some older project might still have class components
- Class component has it's own state as compared to fn components which does not have it's own state
- Class component has life cycle hooks ex: componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate() etc whereas in fn you don't have life cycle hooks by default but you can use additional useEffect etc to get this life cycle hooks
- Cons:
  - It is more complex
  - Has a lot of life cycle hooks by default
  - Not lightweight compared to fn component

### Example

```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button>{this.props.content ?? "Click me!"}</button>;
  }
}

class Label extends React.Component {
  state = {
    error: false,
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <label
        className={this.state.error ? "error" : ""}
        onClick={() =>
          this.setState({
            error: true,
          })
        }
      >
        {this.props.text}
      </label>
    );
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("App mounted");
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Label text={"exit"} />
        <Button content="Close" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
