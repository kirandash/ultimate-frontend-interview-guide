## What is a functional component in react?

- Functional component is a function that returns a JSX markup.
- Functional component does not have it'w own state. It just renders some JSX. We will discuss `useState` later but it is not built in functional component.
  - Any variables that are inside will be initialized and destroyed with it.
- It has been popularized recently over class based components because of how flexible and composable and lean it is by default.

### Examples

```
const Button = (props) => {
  return <button>{props.content ?? "Click me!"}</button>
}

const Label = ({ text = 'No Label' }) => {
  return <label>{text}</label>
}

const App = () => {
  return <div>
    <Label text={'exit'} />
    <Button content="Close" />
  </div>;
}
```
