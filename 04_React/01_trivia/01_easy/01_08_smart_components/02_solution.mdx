## What is a smart component in react?

### Description

- Smart aka Container component vs Dumb aka Presentational component
- Smart/Container Component:
  - A component that has some state or some business logic
- Presentational Component:
  - Which just returns some JSX to render
  - does not have any state

### Example

- Smart:

```jsx
const Button = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState();

  return (
    <>
      <label>{count}</label>
      <button onClick={(prevCount) => setCount(prevCount++)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

- Dumb:

```jsx
const Button = ({ text }) => {
  return <button>{text}</button>;
};
```
