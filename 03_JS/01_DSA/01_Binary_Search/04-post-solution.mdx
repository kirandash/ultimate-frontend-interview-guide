## Post Solution

### Big O:

- Time complexity:
  - O(log(n)): worst and avg
    - worst case is when target is at the edge
    - it is log(n) because it keeps dividing the input by 1/2 every iteration
  - O(1): best case when the target is at the mid idx
  - Note: Binary search assumes that input is sorted. but if input is not sorted then we might need additional time complexity to sort it first.
- Space complexity:
  - O(1)
    - because we are not using any additional memory beside the input

### Edge Cases:

- Non-integer elements in input array
  - handle it by showing error as invalid input
  - or if must allow non-integer array then I will write a custom comparison for non-integer.
