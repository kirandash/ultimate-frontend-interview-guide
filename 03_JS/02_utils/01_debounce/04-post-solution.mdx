## Post Solution

### Edge Cases

- I made sure to pass both `this` context and the args using `.apply()`
- Please use normal fn as the returned fn of debounce because if we use arrow fn then it will loose context of `this`

### Follow up question:

- why there is no check for if timer exists before you do `clearTimeout(timerId)`
  - additional check is not required bcoz JS is forgiving and will not throw any error if we are trying to clear an invalid timer ID.
