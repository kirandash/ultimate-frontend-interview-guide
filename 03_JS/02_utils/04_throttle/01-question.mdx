## Throttle

### Level: Medium, Duration: 15 Minutes, Languages: JS, TS, Frequency: 5/5

### Description

Implement a throttle fn which accepts a callback fn and a delay. Calling this fn should create throttled invocations of the callback.

Definition: It is a technique which is used to control how many times a callback fn should be executed over a period of time. When a fn is throttled, it executes immediately and waits for the delay and executes again after the delay. And in between if there is any call, it will be ignored.

### Examples

```
  const increment = (() => {
    let count = 0;
    return () => {
      count++;
      console.log(count)
    }
  })();

  const throttledIncrement = throttle(increment, 1000)

  throttledIncrement(); // log 1

  setTimeout(() => {
    throttledIncrement()
  }, 400) // not log anything since we are calling before 1000 ms has passed

  setTimeout(() => {
    throttledIncrement()
  }, 1200) // will log 2 since we are calling after 1000ms has passed

  setTimeout(() => {
    throttledIncrement()
  }, 1600) // not log anything because we already called once for the last 1000 ms delay

  setTimeout(() => {
    throttledIncrement()
  }, 3600) // will log 3 since no call has been made in the last 1000 ms interval

  setTimeout(() => {
    throttledIncrement()
  }, 3800) // should not log anything

  // It should log 1, 2, 3
```
